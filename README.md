#ADRIS

A Distro for Roaming Initiative Software is a distro and firmware package for routers and computers taht act as nodes in a Roaming Initiative based network.

##What will we be focusing on first?

Initially ARDIS-T will be the main focus, we plan to aim the initial release at the Omnitik U-5HnD. Initial commits will be composed of resources to get this build going, such as the source code I recently asked MikroTik for, since RouterOS is composed of a good chunk of GPL sotware like the Linux kernel.
